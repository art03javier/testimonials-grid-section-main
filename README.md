## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

# Testimonial Challenge

## HTML Structure:

- Used semantic HTML elements like `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Structured the content using div elements, assigning meaningful IDs and classes.

## CSS Styling:

- Linked an external stylesheet (`style.css`) to apply styles to the HTML elements.
- Utilized flexbox and grid layout for creating a responsive and visually appealing grid structure.
- Set up styling for text, images, and other elements to achieve a consistent design.

## Responsive Design:

- Included a viewport meta tag for responsive behavior across various devices.
- Used media queries or responsive design techniques to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

## Image Handling:

- Incorporated images (`<img>`) within the grid to represent profile pictures and decorative elements.
- Used SVG images for decorative patterns (e.g., the quotation mark).

## Google Fonts Integration:

- Linked to Google Fonts to import the "Barlow Semi Condensed" font for use in the project.

## Content Structure:

- Organized testimonials into a grid layout with multiple sections for different testimonials.
- Included profile pictures, names, verification status, and the actual testimonials.

## Accessibility:

- Added alternative text (`alt` attribute) to images for better accessibility.


### Continued development

In my next project, I plan to introduce new features, enhance functionality, incorporate interactive elements, and add additional content. Additionally, I aim to address browser compatibility by conducting additional testing and implementing improvements for better compatibility.
